# Rag-MovieRecomender

## **Overview**:
This is a GEN AI  project that uses RAG to recommend movies to a user based on the criteria specified by the user  

This is a revised version of my initial Kaggle submission for [Gen AI Intensive Course Capstone 2025Q1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/exal30/capgenai).  

It includes the following changes:  
- Uses the Mistral model as an RAG agent  
- Has a chat-like UI built with **Streamlit**  
- Uses `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` to embed the movie information
